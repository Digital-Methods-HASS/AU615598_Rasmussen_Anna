## QUESTION 1: How many elements in the vector are greater than 2?
```{r}
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, NA, 1, 8, 3, 1, 4, NA, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, NA)
na.omit(rooms)
rooms <- na.omit(rooms)
rooms[rooms>2]
length(rooms[rooms>2])
```
By running this code, I find the answer 8

## QUESTION 2: What is the result of running median function?
```{r} 
median(rooms)
```
The result is 1,5 - but as this is rounded to a median of 2 rooms

## QUESTION 3: Inside your R Project (.Rproj), install the 'tidyverse' package and use the download.file() and read_csv() function to read the SAFI_clean.csv dataset into your R project as 'interviews' digital object (see instructions in https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/setup.html and 'Starting with Data' section)
```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
interviews <- read_csv("data/SAFI_clean.csv", na = "NULL")
